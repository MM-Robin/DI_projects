# DI_projects

the aim of lab session-2 is 
  1. The VHDL coding of the digital circuit in a text editor,
  2. Simulation of full adder.
  3. Simuation of N-bit adder.
  4. Extension of N-bit adder by introducing a carry flag.
  5. Simulation of Arithmatic Adder.
  6. The definition of test cases and implementation of a test
      bench that allows you to simulate the model on a PC,
  7. Once the simulation proved a correct function of the VHDL model,
      the model can be synthesised into a digital circuit for the target device
     (here: Complex Programmable Logical Device (CPLD)),
  8. Implementation on the CPLD and validation of the correct function with
     switches,LEDs and measurements of physical parameters like propagation delays with the oscilloscope.

     
The aim of lab session-3 is 
  -> simulation of MODULO-16 up/down counter.
  -> simulation of counter counting from 0-f.
  -> simulation of 7 segment display.
  -> extension of 7segment display for a new output.
 -> to schedule actions or measure accurate times in microcontrollers,
 -> to schedule control modes and operating times of machines or
 -> to define the timing behavior in digital communication systems.
